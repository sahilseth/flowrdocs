:func:`to_flow`

Create flow objects

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 to_flow(x, ...)

"to_flow"(x, def, ...)

"to_flow"(x, def, grp_col, jobname_col, cmd_col, flowname, flow_run_path, platform, submit = FALSE, execute = FALSE, qobj, ...)

"to_flow"(x, def, flowname, flow_run_path, desc, ...)

Arguments

x
    path (char. vector) to flow_mat, a data.frame or a list.
...
    Supplied to specific functions like `to_flow.data.frame <to_flow.data.frame.html>`_
def
    A flow definition table. Basically a table with resource requirements and mapping of the jobs in this flow
grp_col
    column name used to split x (flow_mat). Default: `samplename`
jobname_col
    column name with job names. Default: `jobname`
cmd_col
    column name with commands. Default: `cmd`
flowname
    name of the flow
flow_run_path
    Path to a folder. Main operating folder for this flow. Default it `getOption("flow_run_path")`.
platform
    character vector, specifying the platform to use. local, lsf, torque, moab, sge, slurm, ...
This over-rides the platform column in flow_def.
submit
    Depreciated. Use submit_flow on flow object this function returns. TRUE/FALSE
execute
    Depreciated. Use submit_flow on flow object this function returns. TRUE/FALSE, an paramter to submit_flow()
qobj
    Depreciated. A object of class `queue <queue.html>`_.
desc
    Advanced Use. final flow name. don't change.


Value
""""""""""""""""""

<dl>
Returns a flow object. If execute=TRUE, fobj is rich with information about where and how
the flow was executed. It would include details like jobids, path to exact scripts run etc.
To use kill_flow, to kill all the jobs one would need a rich flow object, with job ids present.
</dl>
Description
""""""""""""""""""

Use a set of shell commands and flow definiton to create `flow <flow.html>`_ object.
Details
""""""""""""""""""

The parameter x can be a path to a flow_mat, or a data.frame (as read by read_sheet).
This is a minimum three column matrix with:
samplename<TAB>jobname<TAB>cmd
## Behaviour, in terms of submit and execute
submit=FALSE execute=FALSE: default, only flow object creation
submit=TRUE, execute=FALSE: dry-run
submit=TRUE, execute=TRUE: submit to cluster
