rerun
-----------

.. :func:`rerun`

Re-run a pipeline in case of hardware or software failures.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   **hardware**  no change required, simple rerun: ``rerun(x=flow_wd)``
-   **software**  either a change to flowmat or flowdef has been made: ``rerun(x=flow_wd, mat = new_flowmat, def = new_flowdef)``

**NOTE:**

*flow_wd*: flow working directory, the input used for `status <#status>`_


Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

 
 rerun(x, ...)
 
 ## method for class 'character'
 rerun(x, ...)
 
 ## method for class 'flow'
 rerun(x, mat, def, start_from, execute = TRUE, kill = TRUE, ...)
 


Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


x
    flow working directory

...
    not used

mat
    (optional) flowmat fetched from previous submission if missing. For more information regarding the format refer to `to_flowmat <#to_flowmat>`_

def
    (optional) flowdef fetched from previous submission if missing.  For more information regarding the format refer to `to_flowdef <#to_flowdef>`_

start_from
    which job to start from

execute
    [logical] whether to execute or not

kill
    (optional) logical indicating whether to kill the jobs from old flow


Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function fetches details regarding the previous execution from the flow working directory (flow_wd).
It reads the `flow <#flow>`_ object from the flow_details.rds file, and extracts flowdef and flowmat from it
using `to_flowmat <#to_flowmat>`_ and `to_flowdef <#to_flowdef>`_ functions.
**New flowmat / flowdef**  for re-run:
Optionally, if either of these (flowmat or flowdef) are supplied, supplied ones are used instead for the new submission.
This functions efficiently updates job details of the latest submission into the previous file; thus information
regarding previous job ids and their status is not lost.


Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

 ## **Not run**: 
 # rerun_flow(wd = wd, fobj = fobj, execute = TRUE, kill = TRUE)
 # ## **End(Not run)**
