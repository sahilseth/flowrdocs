Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

 
 to_flowdef(x, ...)
 
 ## method for class 'flowmat'
 to_flowdef(x, sub_type, dep_type, prev_jobs, queue = "short", platform = "torque", memory_reserved = "2000", cpu_reserved = "1", walltime = "1:00", ...)
 
 ## method for class 'flow'
 to_flowdef(x, ...)
 
 ## method for class 'character'
 to_flowdef(x, ...)
 
 as.flowdef(x, ...)
 
 is.flowdef(x)
