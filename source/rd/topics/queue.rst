queue
===============

:func:`queue`

Create a ``queue`` object which containg details about how a job is submitted.

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 queue(object, platform = c("lsf", "torque", "sge", "moab", "local"), format = "", queue = "long", walltime, memory, cpu = 1, extra_opts = "", submit_exe, cwd = "~/flows", nodes = 1, jobname = "name", email = Sys.getenv("USER"), dependency = list(), server = "localhost", verbose = TRUE, stderr = "~/flowr/tmp", stdout = "~/flowr", ...)

Arguments

object
    this is not used currenlty, ignore.
platform
    Required and important. Currently supported values are 'lsf' and 'torque'. [Used by class job]
format
    [advanced use] We have a default format for the final command line string generated for 'lsf' and 'torque'.
queue
    the type of queue your group usually uses
'bsub' etc.
walltime
    max walltime of a job.
memory
    The amount of memory reserved. Units depend on the platform used to process jobs
cpu
    number of cpus you would like to reserve [Used by class job]
extra_opts
    [advanced use] Extra options to be supplied while create the job submission string.
submit_exe
    [advanced use] Already defined by 'platform'. The exact command used to submit jobs to the cluster example 'qsub'
cwd
    [debug use] Ignore
nodes
    [advanced use] number of nodes you would like to request. *optional* [Used by class job]
jobname
    [debug use] name of this job in the computing cluster
email
    [advanced use] Defaults to system user, you may put you own email though may get tons of them.
dependency
    [debug use] a list of jobs to complete before starting this one
server
    [not used] This is not implemented currently. This would specify the head node of the computing cluster. At this time submission needs to be done on the head node of the cluster where flow is to be submitted
verbose
    [logical] TRUE/FALSE
stderr
    [debug use] Ignore
stdout
    [debug use] Ignore
...
    other passed onto object creation. Example: memory, walltime, cpu


Description
""""""""""""""""""

This function defines the queue used to submit jobs to the cluster. In essence details about the
computing cluster in use.
Details
""""""""""""""""""

## Resources:
Can be defined **once** using a `queue <queue.html>`_ object and recylced to all the jobs in a flow. If resources (like memory, cpu, walltime, queue) are supplied at the
job level they overwrite the one supplied in `queue <queue.html>`_
Nodes: can be supplied ot extend a job across multiple nodes. This is purely experimental and not supported.
## Server:
This a hook which may be implemented in future.
## Submission script:
The 'platform' variable defines the format, and submit_exe; however these two are avaible for someone to create a custom submission command.


Examples
""""""""""""""""""
::

 qobj <- queue(platform='lsf')
 **Setting default time to: 72:00. If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail. You may change this in job()
 ****Setting default memory to: 10000. If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail.
