fetch
===============

:func:`fetch`

Two generic functions to search for pipelines and configuration files.

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 fetch(x, places, urls, verbose = get_opts("verbose"))

fetch_pipes(x, places, last_only = FALSE, urls = get_opts("flowr_pipe_urls"), silent = FALSE, ask = TRUE)

fetch_conf(x = "flowr.conf", places, ...)

Arguments

x
    name of the file to search for
places
    places (paths) to look for it. Its best to use the defaults
urls
    urls to look for, works well for pipelines.
verbose
    be chatty?
last_only
    [fetch_pipes only]. If multiple pipelines match the pattern, return the last one.
silent
    [fetch_pipes() only]. logical, be silent even if no such pipeline is available.
ask
    ask before downloading or copying, not used !
...
    not used


Description
""""""""""""""""""

These functions help in searching for specific files in the user's space.
``fetch_pipes()``: Fetches pipelines in the following places, in this specific order:
-<li> **user's folder**: ``~/flowr/pipelines``
</li>
<li> **current wd**:
</li>
**NOTE:** If same pipeline is availabe in multiple places; one from the later
folder would be selected up. Such that, giving priority to user's home, and current working
directories. Which is what, one would intuitiuvely expect.
``fetch_conf()``: Fetches configuration files in the following places:
-<li> **package**: ``conf`` folders in flowr and ngsflows packages.
</li>
<li> **user's folder**: ``~/flowr/conf`` folder.
</li>
<li> **current wd**:
</li>
**NOTE:**
This function would greedily return all matching conf files. One would load all of them
in the order returned by this functions. If the same variable is
repeated in multiple files, value from the later files would be final. Thus ( as explained above ), giving
priority to options defined in user's home and current working directories.
By default flowr loads, ``flowr.conf`` and ``ngsflows.conf``.
See the following details sections, for more explanation on this.
Details
""""""""""""""""""

For example flowr has a variable ``flow_run_path`` where it puts all the execution logs etc.
The default values is picked up from packages's internal ``flowr.conf`` file.
To redefine this value, one could create a new file called ``~/flowr/conf/flowr.conf`` and
add a line:
``flow_run_path<TAB>my_awesome_path``, where <TAB> is a tab character, since these are tab
seperated files.
Also at any time you can run, ``load_conf('super_specific_opts.conf')``; to load custom options.


Examples
""""""""""""""""""
::

 {
 
 ## let us find a default conf file
 conf = fetch_conf("flowr.conf");conf
 ## load this
 load_opts(conf)
 
 ## this returns a list, which prints pretty
 pip = fetch_pipes("sleep_pipe")
 pip$name
 pip$pipe
 pip$def
 
 }
