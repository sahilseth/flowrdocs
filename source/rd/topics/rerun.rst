Re-run a pipeline in case of hardware or software failures.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   **hardware**  no change required, simple rerun: ``rerun(x=flow_wd)``
-   **software**  either a change to flowmat or flowdef has been made: ``rerun(x=flow_wd, mat = new_flowmat, def = new_flowdef)``

**NOTE:**

*flow_wd*: flow working directory, the input used for `status <#status>`_

Description
""""""""""""""""""

-<li> **hardware** no change required, simple rerun: ``rerun(x=flow_wd)``
</li>
<li> **software** either a change to flowmat or flowdef has been made: ``rerun(x=flow_wd, mat = new_flowmat, def = new_flowdef)``

Details
""""""""""""""""""

This function fetches details regarding the previous execution from the flow working directory (flow_wd).
It reads the `flow <#flow>`_ object from the flow_details.rds file, and extracts flowdef and flowmat from it
using `to_flowmat <#to_flowmat>`_ and `to_flowdef <#to_flowdef>`_ functions.
**New flowmat / flowdef**  for re-run:
Optionally, if either of these (flowmat or flowdef) are supplied, supplied ones are used instead for the new submission.
This functions efficiently updates job details of the latest submission into the previous file; thus information
regarding previous job ids and their status is not lost.


Examples

 ## **Not run**: 
 # rerun_flow(wd = wd, fobj = fobj, execute = TRUE, kill = TRUE)
