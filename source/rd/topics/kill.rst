kill
===============

:func:`kill`

Kill all jobs submitted to the computing platform, for one or multiple flows

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 kill(x, ...)

"kill"(x, force = FALSE, ...)

"kill"(x, kill_cmd, jobid_col = "job_sub_id", ...)

Arguments

x
    either path to flow wd or object of class `flow <flow.html>`_
...
    not used
force
    You need to set force=TRUE, to kill multiple flows. This makes sure multiple flows are NOT killed by accident.
kill_cmd
    The command used to kill. flowr tries to guess this commands, as defined in the detect_kill_cmd(). Supplying
it here; fot custom platoforms.
jobid_col
    Advanced use. The column name in 'flow_details.txt' file used to fetch jobids to kill


Description
""""""""""""""""""

**A pipeline requires files which are created at the end of the submit_flow command**.
Even if you want to kill the flow, its best to let submit_flow do its job, when done simply use kill(flow_wd).
If submit_flow is interrupted, flow_details etc files are not created, thus flowr looses the association
of jobs with flow instance.


Examples
""""""""""""""""""
::

 ## **Not run**: 
 # 
 # ## example for terminal
 # ## flowr kill_flow x=path_to_flow_directory
 # ## In case path matches multiple folders, flowr asks before killing
 # kill(x='fastq_haplotyper*')
 #  Flowr: streamlining workflows
 #  found multiple wds:
 #  /fastq_haplotyper-MS132-20150825-16-24-04-0Lv1PbpI
 #  /fastq_haplotyper-MS132-20150825-17-47-52-5vFIkrMD
 #  Really kill all of them ? kill again with force=TRUE
 # 
 # ## submitting again with force=TRUE will kill them:
 # kill(x='fastq_haplotyper*', force = TRUE)
 # ## **End(Not run)**
