## Don't edit this, you may want to edit the source itself.

These files are automatically generated using package `restr`, which converts Rmd files to rst format as required by `readthedocs`.

For the vignettes the source(s) are *.Rmd files in:

https://github.com/sahilseth/flowr/tree/master/vignettes

The manual pages for all the functions are directly derived from the source code via [roxygen](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) and translated into:
https://github.com/sahilseth/flowr/tree/master/man

These *.Rd files are then read by `restr` to create files compatible for readthedocs.


## Examples:
Documentation for `to_flowr()` is embedded in the code here:
https://github.com/sahilseth/flowr/blob/master/R/to-flow.R
